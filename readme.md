Babbage B.V., Welcome to your new add-on. Please write instructions on how to use your addon in this file. When you compile your addon, users can get help with it by activating addon help from the list item containing your addon in the Addons manager in NVDA. Good documentation is important for your success as an add-on author. Good documentation is esential for a stable add-on, and will persuade potential users to give your add-on a try! I hope you found this add-on creation process easy. If you have any feedback, or instructions, please post  to [The add-on development list](http://www.freelists.org/list/nvda-addons).
Additionally, Please review the [Add-ons development pages](http://addons.nvda-project.org/dev.en.html), and you are strongly encouraged to submit your add-on for review. The review process checks for 5 things.

1. Is your code legal (It must be GPL V.2 since NVDA is GPL V.2. and your add-on is a part of NVDA during execution. Also, add-ons that pirate speech synthesisers, or do other illegal things will not be accepted.
2. Does your code do anything dangerous or outright malicious?
3. Does your code contain any obvious security voneribilities that effect NVDA? Note that if a security vonerability is found, you will be asked to fix it before releasing your next version.
4. Does the add-on break functionality of NVDA in potentially annoying ways, or make NVDA hard to use? (Simple quality check).
5. Does your add-on documentation contain enough information that someone who doesn't look at the code could use it?
